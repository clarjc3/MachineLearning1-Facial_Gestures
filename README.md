# MachineLearning1-Facial_Gestures
Authors: Joshua Clarke

This repo was intended to be for our software but Sione created his own repo and is using that.

Instead, this repo was used for testing purposes, and all gesture detection code for the software has been copied from this repo into Sione's repo located at https://github.com/manulea/MITGUI.

However, if you do want to run the code in this repo, read the following instructions:

# Installing
* using git bash, run the following code: <code>git clone https://github.com/clarjc3/MachineLearning1-Facial_Gestures.git</code>
* download and install a python interpreter such as <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda Prompt</a>

# Running
* cd into the MachineLearning1-Facial_Gestures directory
* run <code>python FRON.py</code>
