# MachineLearning1-Facial_Gestures
Authors: Joshua Clarke

This repo was intended to be for our software but Sione created his own repo and is using that.
Instead, this repo was used for testing purposes, and all gesture detection code for the software has been copied from this repo into Sione's repo located at https://github.com/manulea/MITGUI.
